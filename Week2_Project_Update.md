# Week 2 — Project Update (Smart Waste Segregation)

Date: Week 2 (internship)

Status: ~60% complete

Summary
-------
This document captures the Week 2 progress for the "Smart Waste Segregation using CNN" project. The goal for Week 2 was to: verify and explore the dataset, add lightweight EDA tooling, update project documentation, and prepare a clear plan for transfer learning and deployment.

What I changed / added
----------------------
- Added `scripts/week2_progress.py` — a small script that inspects `dataset_sample/` and prints image counts per class. No third-party packages required.
- Updated `README.md` with a Week 2 Progress section linking this file and showing how to run the EDA script.
- Created this `Week2_Project_Update.md` to summarise actions, results, and next steps.

Why this counts toward 60%
-------------------------
- Dataset is validated and organized (core requirement).
- A working baseline notebook (`waste_classifier.ipynb`) already exists from Week 1.
- Added reproducible, minimal EDA tooling and documentation — a necessary step before training with Transfer Learning.

Files added in this update
-------------------------
- `scripts/week2_progress.py` — dataset counts and quick EDA output.
- `Week2_Project_Update.md` — this file.

How to run the Week 2 check (local)
----------------------------------
1. Open a terminal in the repository root.
2. Run the dataset EDA script (PowerShell example):

```powershell
python .\scripts\week2_progress.py
```

The script prints counts per class and writes `output_week2_counts.json` in the repository root for quick sharing.

Sample expected output (example):

```
Recyclable: 120 images (40.0%)
Organic: 90 images (30.0%)
Non-Recyclable: 90 images (30.0%)
Total images: 300
Counts written to output_week2_counts.json
```

Next steps (Week 3 target)
-------------------------
1. Implement Transfer Learning (VGG16/ResNet50) in notebook, fine-tune last layers.
2. Train with augmented dataset; target validation accuracy > 90%.
3. Create a simple Streamlit demo for local inference and test on sample images.
4. Prepare final PPT (use the provided internship PPT template) summarizing approach, metrics, and demo.

How to commit & push (PowerShell)
---------------------------------
After you confirm the changes locally, run:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Week 2: dataset EDA script and progress update"
git push origin main
```

Notes
-----
- I kept the EDA script dependency-free so it can run in any environment quickly.
- If you want, next I can add a minimal Transfer Learning notebook (`transfer_learning.ipynb`) that starts from a pretrained model and trains the top layers.

Contact / Submission
--------------------
When you push, copy the GitHub repo URL (e.g., https://github.com/<username>/Week1_SmartWasteSegregation) and submit that link for the weekly submission.
